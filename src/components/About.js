      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I have a Bachelor of Arts in Communications, Information Media from the
        University of Technology, Sydney and a Diploma in Information Technology
        from my course at Coder Academy. I have used Ruby on Rails and the MERN
        stack in my projects and gathered agile software development experience.
        I am actively seeking new opportunities to learn or work in new
        projects. I have a strong work ethic and have learnt to work in teams,
        independently, and in leadership roles. These experiences overall have
        molded my greatest traits: Flexibility and Empathy In my spare time, I
        like to learn about hip hop culture, photography, and martial arts. I
        have acheived the status of Taekwondo Australian National Champion
        (2008) and a silver medal in the Australian University Games (2013). I
        have learnt the importance of communication in my travels through the
        interactions with the people i have met from different cultures. I have
        made friends with all types of people from all over the world while
        growing my passion for dance, photography and learning languages. All
        just by listening and understanding rather than speaking. TL;DR I work
        hard, I dance and I code
